  "description": "The scoring-up script takes a finite number of Mensural MEI files, each of which only contains one part (i.e., voice) from a mensural piece and merge them into just one Mensural MEI file in which all the parts are lined up into a score. The alignment of the parts is a complex issue in mensural notation, since the same note-shape can have different durational values (_perfect_ / _imperfect_ / _altered_) depending on the context.",
